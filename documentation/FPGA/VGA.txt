8 VGA Port
The Nexys4 board uses 14 FPGA signals to create a VGA port with 4 bits-per-color and the two standard sync
signals (HS – Horizontal Sync, and VS – Vertical Sync). The color signals use resistor-divider circuits that work in
conjunction with the 75-ohm termination resistance of the VGA display to create 16 signal levels each on the red,
green, and blue VGA signals. This circuit, shown in Fig 11, produces video color signals that proceed in equal
increments between 0V (fully off) and 0.7V (fully on). Using this circuit, 4096 different colors can be displayed, one
for each unique 12-bit pattern. A video controller circuit must be created in the FPGA to drive the sync and color
signals with the correct timing in order to produce a working display system.
