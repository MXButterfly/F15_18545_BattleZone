Summary: Asteroids Implementation by FPGAarcade.
Might be useful since it apparently has a 
rasterizer implementation that we could co-op.
Note that the link I got this from seems to be
the old FPGAarcade svn repo, before they
migrated to the new site. It may or may not go
down, hence why I copied their code to our repo.
