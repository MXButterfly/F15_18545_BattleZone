1)  Andy's Arcade
ID: htay
Link: http://www.andysarcade.de/battlezone.html#roms
Summary: Database containing datasheets/tech info
for Battlezone, including ROMs. Also has links to
information on Vector Generators.

2)  NESHQ
ID: htay
Link: http://www.neshq.com/6502program/
Summary: Resources for programming on the 6502,
including the instruction set, disassemblers and
simulators.

3) BattleZone VM Driver Source
ID: htay
Link: http://tech.quarterarcade.com/tech/MAME/src/bzone.c.html.aspx?g=276
Summary: apparently a c source for a Battlezone
VM. May or may not contain accurate memory mappings.
Could be useful as a resource for cross-referencing
our own disassembly.

4) Easy 6502
ID: htay
Link: http://skilldrick.github.io/easy6502/index.html
Summary: Tutorial on 6502 assembly programming.
Of debtable usefulness, but might help in 
understanding how the original ROM behaved.

5) Atari 6502 Disassembler
ID: htay
Link: http://www.atarimax.com/dis6502/type.htm
Summary: Disassembly program for Atari ROMs. 
Might be useable with MAME Roms to reverse
engineer memory locations and op codes.

6) MAME Emulator
ID: htay
Link: http://www.mame.net/
Summary: Emulator for ROMs that apparently
preserves the original hardware structure in
the arcade machine. I have been able to get
BattleZone running on the emulator in debug
mode currently.

7) MAME Debugger Tutorial (letshack)
ID: htay
Link: http://letshackarcadegames.com/?p=338
Summary: Quick tutorial on how to use the MAME
debugger to step through a ROM. At the very least
we can see what op codes and memory locations
are used through this.
