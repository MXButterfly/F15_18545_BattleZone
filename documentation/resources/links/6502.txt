1)  NESHQ
ID: htay
Link: http://www.neshq.com/6502program/
Summary: Resources for programming on the 6502,
including the instruction set, disassemblers and
simulators.

2) Easy 6502
ID: htay
Link: http://skilldrick.github.io/easy6502/index.html
Summary: Tutorial on 6502 assembly programming.
Of debtable usefulness, but might help in 
understanding how the original ROM behaved.

3) Atari 6502 Disassembler
ID: htay
Link: http://www.atarimax.com/dis6502/type.htm
Summary: Disassembly program for Atari ROMs. 
Might be useable with MAME Roms to reverse
engineer memory locations and op codes.

4) OpenCore 6502 Core
ID: htay
Link: http://opencores.org/project,cpu6502_true_cycle
Summary: OpenCore 6502 Core for the FPGA. Untested
and unverified, but might be a good place to
take. Is dated fof 2010 though.

5) 6502 Testbench
ID: htay
Link: https://github.com/Klaus2m5/6502_65C02_functional_tests
Summary: 6502 Testbench used by the F14 Atari
group for debugging/verifying their 6502 implementation.
I would also strongly recommend reading their
report, as it contains an excellent breakdown of
the 6502's behavior.

6) P65 Assembler
ID: htay
Link: https://hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu/~mcmartin/P65/
Summary: Assembler used by the F08 NES group
to write 6502 code for use on their 6502 core.
May or may not be relevant for us, since we 
are not building the 6502 specifically, but could
be helpful for debugging/verification.

7) Virtual 6502 Simulator
ID: htay
Link: http://e-tradition.net/bytes/6502/
Summary: Online 6502 simulator used by the F08
NES group to verify behavior of their 6502
implementation. Once again, of possible use to
debugging.
